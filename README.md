# Algorithms and Complexity

This repository contains the resources provided by the professors of this class and some **resolutions** of such resources. I finished this class in the year of **2024/2025**, so the files that I present here are the ones the teachers provided us in that year.

:warning: There is **no garanty** that the resolutions are correct, some tests have been made, but this is a **personal project**.

## Contents:

There are two theoretical sets of pdf files, one made by professor Jos√© Bernardo Barros, and the other by Jorge Sousa Pinto.
- **Correction**: I am not going to present much on this chapter, it's not very important in my point of view
- **Complexity**: this chapter discusses the analyses of algorithms and operations, how can we evaluate the cost of such things, providing a way to compare solutions for a problem
- **Data Structures**: this chapter presents the following structures:
    - Hash Tables
    - Heaps (Priority Queues)
    - Balanced Trees (AVL Trees)
- **Graphs**: in this final chapter, it is presented multiple algorithms about graphs, how to represent them, how to traverse them and so on

## Problem Sets

The problem sets folder contains some exercises related to the contents. The pdfs made by JBB have a set of exercises at the end, there (**WILL BE**) are resolutions for that to.
You can also find resolutions for tests and exams.

:warning: This repository is still in (**EARLY**) development, so there will be missing some things.
